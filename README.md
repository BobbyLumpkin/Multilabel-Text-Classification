# Multilabel-Text-Classification

An exploration of multilabel methods applied to text categorization. We train binary relevance, novel algorithmic adaptations, and deep learning models to the popular "Reuters-21578" dataset (often used as a benchmark in text categorization). We compare models trained using two different feature-generating approaches: (1) tf-idf vectors and (2) sequences of integers fed into learned word-embeddings.

In the bag-of-words approach (tf-idf vectors), We'll also explore various dimension reduction techniques. We look at principal components analysis for deriving low dimensional linear representations of our data, and ANN autoencoders for deriving low dimensional (potentially) non-linear representations of our data.
