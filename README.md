# Multilabel-Text-Classification

An exploration of multilabel methods applied to text categorization. We train binary relevance, novel algorithmic adaptations, and deep learning models to the popular "Reuters-21578" dataset (often used as a benchmark in text categorization). We compare models trained using two different preprocessing approaches: (1) tf-idf vectors and (2) sequences of integers fed into learned word-embeddings.

We'll also explore various dimension reduction techniques. We'll look at principal components analysis for deriving low dimensional linear representations, and ANN autoencoders to derive low dimensional (potentially) non-linear representations.
